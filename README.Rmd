# OEC Product Space

## Description

Scripts to recreate the trade data available at the [Observatory of Economic Complexity](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/). 

We have a repo explaining the methodological details. Please visit [OEC Documentation](https://observatory-economic-complexity.github.io/oec-documentation/) and the [Official website](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/) for the details. 

These scripts are released under MIT license.

## How to use this project

While you can run the scripts from UNIX terminal, we highly recommend [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

Each project is organized as an RStudio project. Each project contains a master script titled `0-some-function.R` at the top level but some projects such as _Product Space_ are organized in subfolders where each subfolder contains a master script.

The master script, for any case, runs a function with user prompt and/or simple scripts. The safe way to run this without errors is to open the project and then run the master script from RStudio.

[OEC Packages Snapshot](https://github.com/observatory-economic-complexity/oec-packages-snapshot) stores all packages and its dependencies used across all repositories under this organization. To ease reproducibility [OEC Bundles](https://github.com/observatory-economic-complexity/oec-bundles) contains several bundles to avoid dependencies or packages related problems, and this project already contains an unbundled set of packages.

You can read more about RStudio projects [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects).

## Project structure

```
oec-yearly-datasets
└── README.md
└── README.Rmd
└── hs92-sitc
|    └── 0-do-all.R
|    └── 0-scripts
|    └── 1-layouts-raw
|    └── 2-layouts-d3plus1
|    └── 3-layouts-d3plus2
└── packrat
```

## Output

The script generates different files organized under `hs92-sitc/2-layouts-rpackage/` and `hs92-sitc/3-layouts-d3plus2/`.

### Generated files (HS 92 layouts fro D3plus 2)

#### HS 92 edges

```{r edges1, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
skimr::skim(jsonlite::fromJSON("hs92-sitc/3-layouts-d3plus2/hs92-4-links-d3p2.json")) %>% skimr::kable()
```

#### HS 92 nodes

```{r nodes1, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
skimr::skim(jsonlite::fromJSON("hs92-sitc/3-layouts-d3plus2/hs92-4-nodes-d3p2.json")) %>% skimr::kable()
```
